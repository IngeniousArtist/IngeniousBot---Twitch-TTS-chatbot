Always have faith. Always have hope.
The key is to make it. :key:
Key to more success is clean heart and clean face.
I haven't taken a loss because everything I've done has been a working process to win. 
They don't want you to win.
Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back. It's a cold world out there.
Be a star. Be a Superstar. :glowing_star: 
All I do is WIN, WIN, WIN no matter what. :trophy:
The other day the grass was brown, now its green cuz I ain't give up. Never surrender.
When you stop making excuses and you work hard and go hard you will be very successful.
The key is to enjoy life, because they don't want you to enjoy life.
They'll try to close the door on youâ€¦ Just open it. :key:
To succeed, you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed.
In life everyone has a choice. The key is: make a right choice.
Bless up. Don't play yourself.
The key is to be honest. Be honest, but don't play yourself.
You do know it cost money to put a t-shirt on your back? You do know it cost money to have a house? You do know it cost money to eat? Get money, don't let these people fool you.
We have to get money. We have no choice. It cost money to eat.
The key to more success is coco butter.
They never said winning was easy.
I know that I've been put on this Earth to make people happy, to inspire people, and to uplift people. That's a beautiful thing.
I can deal with everything. I got the answer for anything.
There will be roadblocks but we will overcome them.
Working all winter shining all summer
Some of the guys when they play, they try to keep it reality. Nah, I need the best everything.
Always have faith. Always have hope.
The key is: never fold. :key:
They don't want you to win. They don't want you get healthy. They don't want you to exercise. And they don't want you to have that view.
There will be road blocks but we will overcome it.
